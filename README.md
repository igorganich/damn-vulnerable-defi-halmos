# Halmos vs Damn Vulnerable DeFi

Halmos vs Damn Vulnerable DeFi is the series of articles about solving the Damn Vulnerable DeFi CTF using the Halmos symbolic analyzer. 

Since theredguild have released Damn Vulnerable Defi v4, that is fully migrated to foundry-based testing, it is very comfortable to use Halmos to solve these challenges.

This material should be considered as a tutorial about possibilities of using Halmos against CTFs or building attacks on smart contracts.

A comparison with fuzzing techniques using Foundry fuzzing and Echidna in the context of Damn Vulnerable DeFi solutions was also described.

WARNING: This repository is still in progress, so there may not be solutions for all problems.
